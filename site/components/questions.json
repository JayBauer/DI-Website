      "title": "What is Magnetic Resonance Imaging?",
      "answer": "<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging, commonly called MRI, is a non-invasive, painless procedure that produces very detailed pictures of soft body tissue and organs without using ionizing radiation, as with other diagnostic procedures such as X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT). Using a large magnet, radio waves and complex computer and software technology, MRI scans the patient's body and produces two or three-dimensional images of body tissues. MRI is important as both a screening and diagnostic tool due to its ability to detect many cardiovascular, neurological, oncological and musculoskeletal diseases/injuries earlier and more accurately than other modalities.</p>",

      "title": "What is the MRI scanner comprised of?",
      "answer": "<p>The MRI scanning device is a large machine housed in a specially prepared examination room. During the exam, the patient lies on a table that moves him into the centre of a strong magnetic field within the MRI scanner. Scanners are classified as either \"Closed\" or \"Open\" MRI. In a closed MRI, the patient is placed inside a long cylindrical hole, which is approximately 60cm in diameter and open on both ends. Newer \"Short-bore\" closed MRI scanners have a cylinder approximately 70cm long, half the length of a traditional closed scanner. In an open MRI, the patient is placed within a scanner that is open on all sides and is not confining, making it sometimes more appropriate for claustrophobic or larger patients and more comfortable for children.</p><p>The MRI scanner is further identified by the strength of its magnetic field. Closed scanners have a magnetic field strength of between 1.0 and 3.0 tesla and are thereby classified as \"High-field\" MRI. Open scanners have a magnetic field strength of between 0.2 and 1.0 tesla, making them \"Low-field\" MRI. High-field MRI produces higher quality images in a lower average scan time (25 to 45 minutes) than low-field MRI (60 minutes).</p><p>An MRI technologist interacts with the patient before and during the scan. The technologist moves the patient into and out of the scanner and operates the scanner from an adjacent room. A radiologist prescribes which imaging sequences are to be used to record the images, which can then be displayed, printed, stored and transmitted electronically. In some cases, the patient may receive an injection of contrast dye (Imaging Enhancement Medium), which helps make the details in the MRI images clearer. The radiologist reads and interprets the images for irregularities of various structures within the body, including abnormal size or position of organs, bones, blood vessels or soft tissue structures, presence of growths or lesions, etc.</p>",

      "title": "Will an MRI scan hurt or make me feel uncomfortable?",
      "answer": "<p>An MRI scan is completely painless. The only difficult aspect is the necessity to lie as still as possible for the duration of the scan. You may also be asked to hold your breath for a few seconds while the scan is being taken. MRI scans usually require 20 minutes, but some types of exams can take longer to finish.</p><p>Some MRI scans involve having an injection of contrast dye to give the radiologist additional information. This makes certain tissues and blood vessels show up more clearly and in greater detail. The contrast dye is administered through an IV in your arm. There are few or no side-effects of this solution, and the injection is just like any other you might have had.</p>",

      "title": "How does one prepare for an MRI scan?",
      "answer": "<p>Patients are required to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the start of their scheduled exam.</p><p>Before the exam starts, you may be required to fill out a few forms. Depending on which part of your body is being scanned, you may need to change into a gown during the procedure. If you prefer to wear your own clothes, they should not have metal zippers, fasteners, buttons, underwire (bras), belts or buckles, as the MRI scanner produces strong magnetic fields. it is also important to remove any loose metal objects from your body, including:</p><p><ul><li>Watches</li><li>Jewelry (such as earrings and necklaces)</li><li>Piercings (such as ear, nipple, and nose rings)</li><li>Dentures (false teeth)</li><li>Hearing aids</li><li>Wigs (some wigs contain traces of metal)</li></ul></p>",

      "title": "What happens if I am claustrophobic, or get anxious during the MRI scan?",
      "answer": "<p>If at any time you are uncomfortable, or feel yourself getting upset, you can talk to the technologist through the two-way intercom. You will have an emergency call bell. Mirrors or eye covers can be provided. There is a fan inside the bore for airflow. Remember the magnet bore is open at both ends. Nothing will close on you. If you are clinically claustrophobic, tell your referring doctor or specialist. He or she can even provide you with a sedative to bring along if you need one. If your physician has prescribed a sedative, please ensure that you have someone who can drive you home.</p>",
